# Plasma Pass

Plasma Pass is a Plasma applet to access password from [pass, the standard UNIX password manager](https://www.passwordstore.org).

More details and a video in [my blog post about Plasma Pass](https://www.dvratil.cz/2018/05/plasma-pass/).

You don't need the *pass* utility installed on your system in order for Plasma Pass to work,
only GnuPG is needed in order to be able to decrypt the password.

Plasma Pass looks for the password directory by default in `$HOME/.password-store`, but
it can be customized through `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` environment variable.

## Build Instructions

1) Install necessary dependencies

Fedora:

```
dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative-devel kf5-plasma-devel kf5-ki18n-devel kf5-kitemmodels-devel liboath-devel qgpgme-devel liboath-devel
```

Debian/Ubuntu:

```
apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev libkf5plasma-dev libkf5i18n-dev libkf5itemmodels-dev liboauth-dev libgpgmepp-dev liboath-dev
```

2) Clone source code:

```
git clone https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-pass.git
```

3) Compile:

```
cd plasma-pass
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=YOURPREFIX ..
make
make install
```
(replace `YOURPREFIX` with where your Plasma is installed)

4) Restart Plasma:

```
plasmashell --replace &
```

Alternatively you can also view the applet with `plasmoidviewer`:

```
plasmoidviewer -a org.kde.plasma.pass
```
